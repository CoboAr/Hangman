# Hangman
An implementation of Hangman game using pygame python library.

## Requirements
pip install Pygame   
pip install wonderwords

## How does it work?
Once the user click the START button, a random word will be generated. The user needs to guess each time a letter. If the letter is part of the random word generated, it will count as a correct guess; otherwise it will count as an incorrect guess. Each time the player makes an incorrect guess a body part of Hangman will be drawn into the screen. After 6 wrong guesses Hangman is fully created and the player loses the game. A prompt will be displayed on the screen asking the player if he wants to start a new game by pressing "n" or exiting the game by pressing "esc". Each time the player makes a correct guess, the letter will be displayed on the screen leaving empty only the other missing letters to complete the word. If the player finds all missing letters, the player wins the game. A prompt will be displayed on the screen asking the player if he wants to start a new game by pressing "n" or exiting the game by pressing "esc". The player can exit the game anytime by pressing "esc".
